## About

**croaker** is a VST3/CLAP plugin that will make your audio sound like a croaking frog üê∏ (it's actually just a multi effects plugin).

**croaker** is made with the following:

- dsp with my own library, [fx](https://github.com/renzol2/fx)
- plugin boilerplate using [nih-plug](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/nih-plug), and UI using [Vizia](https://github.com/vizia/vizia)

this project is being completed partially in fulfillment of the senior capstone requirement for the [ Computer Science + Music degree program ](https://music.illinois.edu/admission/undergraduate-programs-and-application/undergraduate-degrees/bachelor-of-science-cs-music/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

## Download

A temporary download link to standalone, VST3, and CLAP versions can be found here: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MUqEvY7qZCM-ucpszpEqc7d3vIfdQkVw?usp=sharing)

I have only tested plugin on macOS Monterey 12.5 using Audacity and Ableton Live 11. I haven't been able to run this on Reason 12. Also, since I don't have an Apple Developer account (yet), I haven't codesigned these applications. So, you'll need to codesign yourself. Here are some useful links:

## Building
